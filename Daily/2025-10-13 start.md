## Anything
I am going to practice writing without interruption 5 minutes at at time every day for 30 minutes. I will do this daily in daily notes. I should update the daily notes template with a level 2 heading called Write Anything. Rather than creating a template I will do this writing session in a daily note making use of oob setup.

[[Spline on you]] is a Project and I will also track it as an App. Rest API. Youtube and malechimp

I will start taking Daily Stand-up notes here and mail it back if necessary. It makes sense to have Template - maybe meeting template?

I need to think about using templates effectively.

Daily stand up notes: Meeting Template
Spline Project: App Template, Project Template
REST API/Spring Boot implementation documentation: Lesson
How to: Lesson
K8s Plantuml diagrams - extension
