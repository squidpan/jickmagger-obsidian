## Preamble

My primary responsibility within the squad is to ensure every Prime release is successfully deployed to the integration environment and higher environments (QA, PROD).


At the Bank, I worked on documenting, testing, deploying on NPQS to all Linux environments. I also worked with the product owner and scrum master to create JIRA tickets for team members.

## Experience

### Documentation - NPQS

- NPQS Data (Ticker, Benchmark) distribution to Internal Consumer applications (connection, distribution type (files, views))
- NPQS release deployment steps documents
- NPQS failover/switchover documents
- NPQS Data (C0 data distribution fields)
- NPQS Gateways (5) 
- Price Leader mechanism
- Suspect processing/Workflow
- MBS Payup tools - new feeds IMG, TSAR
- Architecture diagrams and PPTX

### Requirements and JIRA

- Functional requirements from the Business through Product owner, Scrum master
- Non functional requirements from Infrastructure and Bank wide Strategic initiatives and architecture, BAU
- NPQS body of work created as JIRA epics and stories
- Each NPQS release is planned from a prioritized list of items that need to be delivered

### NPQS requirements releases and deployments - Prime classic in Linux

My primary responsibility within the squad is to ensure every Prime release is successfully deployed to all higher environments (QA, PROD).

Starting in our Pre-QA environment, I follow directions from Edward Chubin, our technical lead in all things deployment, Linux, coding, github (super important) and shows. I test out all deployment commands, revise documentation accordingly and perform basic testing (e.g. suspect data cleansing using workflow, data quality reports review, etc.) before we collectively bless the release worthy of a trip to higher environments.

As part of the release process, the new code is reviewed with the rest of the developers where questions are addressed and issues identified and resolved.

On the day of deployment, all technical staff (system engineer (se), dba and Operations Support team follow the steps I call out and execute the commands.

I helped setup Jira tickets for the squad when requested by the Product owner and scrum master. I have been learning cloud concepts in a timely manner.

### Workflow and regression test PRIME

#### Suspect Price cleansing

### OPS360 - Cloud distribution

I have been proactive in my learning of cloud computing concepts (Kubernetes, Rest API, etc) to have skills that are relevant to support the current NPQS pricing data distribution through Ops360 microservices in both the Private cloud (Openshift 4) and Government cloud (CFS2.0). The learning path is steep and long and I intend to chip away at it consistently.

Creating together in some capacity beyond the Prime arena is the goal. The current high priority effort, Spline application, is being built to improve upon the current solution that is complex and obscure in its implementation soon to be sunset - this is an opportunity for me to learn and sink my teeth into it in whatever capacity (i dont care what) and get my foot in the door. For that I will be working closely with Mr. Spline our resident SME/expert in ops360 cloud stuff.

### Current Focus and Interests
documentation: Spline API and others
testing: Rest API testing using Postman
CI/CD using Gitlab

- 
- 
- the Bank's markets pricing data hub for several key consumer applications
- NPQS squad that consists of Product Owner, Scrum master, developers, Ops, DBA, SA, Infrastructure, etc.
- managed JIRA tickets for the development team, creating tickets with initial description, initial estimates, pertinent background information
- Deployment steps documentation that followed on the day of deployment by SA, DBA and OPS
- Documentation
	- Confluence, VS code, Draw.io, Plantuml, Excel
- Interests
	- Rest API, swagger, Spring Boot Web MVC, React, node
	- K8s, microservices
	- gitlab, postman
	- grafana, Prometheus
	- helm
	- oauth2, Okta
	- java/maven
	- OCP4
	- Proxmox
	- Reading books, Writing, music, smoking

the market data pricing services from end to end. with worked closely I spend most of my working hours listening, taking notes, making drawings
