# Goals

Considering all agreed objectives for this review period, including personal development goals, professional/function-specific goals, contribution to business priorities, and commercial awareness.

## Overall Delivery Against Goals 

1. How would you rate your overall delivery against your goals?

Good.

My primary responsibility within the squad is to ensure every Prime release is successfully deployed to all higher environments (QA, PROD).

Starting in our Pre-QA environment, I follow directions from Edward Chubin, our technical lead in all things deployment, Linux, coding, github (super important) and shows. I test out all deployment commands, revise documentation accordingly and perform basic testing (e.g. suspect data cleansing using workflow, data quality reports review, etc.) before we collectively bless the release worthy of a trip to higher environments.

As part of the release process, the new code is reviewed with the rest of the developers where questions are addressed and issues identified and resolved.

On the day of deployment, all technical staff (system engineer (se), dba and Operations Support team follow the steps I call out and execute the commands.

 2. Please give a brief overview on your overall delivery, any successes or challenges you faced.
 
All Prime release deployments were successful.
I helped setup Jira tickets for the squad when requested by the Product owner and scrum master. I have been learning cloud concepts in a timely manner.

Taking a more active role in Mulesoft deployment has been difficult as there were communication issues between current mulesoft-guy and us. Any 'hand holding' support beyond the basic training (which you really need) was hard to come by. If I gain experience with Spline deployment, I should be able to handle mulesoft deployment tasks.
# Values in Action

3. Since the last review period, how have you demonstrated Gresham Values in your day-to-day work Please share examples where relevant (you do not need to provide an example for every value).

- Embrace Learning: I have been proactive in my learning of cloud computing concepts (Kubernetes, Rest API, etc) to have skills that are relevant to support the current NPQS pricing data distribution through Ops360 microservices in both the Private cloud (Openshift 4) and Government cloud (CFS2.0). The learning path is steep and long and I intend to chip away at it consistently.

- Create Together: Creating together in some capacity beyond the Prime arena is the goal. The current high priority effort, Spline application, is being built to improve upon the current solution that is complex and obscure in its implementation soon to be sunset - this is an opportunity for me to learn and sink my teeth into it in whatever capacity (i dont care what) and get my foot in the door. For that I will be working closely with Mr. Spline our resident SME/expert in ops360 cloud stuff.

- Make it Simple: 

3. How would you rate the extent to which you have demonstrated the Gresham Values in your day-to-day work? 
- Good


# Development & Future Focus

5. What should be the top 2-3 focus areas for the next review period?

documentation: Spline API and others
testing: Rest API testing using Postman
CI/CD using Gitlab

6. What resources, tools, training, or opportunities would help you succeed in the next period?
Gitlab, Postman

# Continuous Feedback
