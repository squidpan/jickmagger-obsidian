## Hello
Hello Chi-ah,

Today is our 10th anniversary. You and Woojin were here today 10 years ago. So much happened during that time and at the end of the day, I am so happy that I am talking to you _like this_ _again_ right now!

Diamonds and Rust, You heard it before?

This song has been living rent-free in my head for several weeks ever since I heard it again while searching for Blackmore's Night concert tickets. 

Actually you and I first heard it covered by Judas Priest in 1978! you probably don't remember. You were more into Breaking the law!


This original version by Joan Baez is now my favorite and way up there when it comes lyrics that blow your mind sans-arret.

They say the song is about memories.

_Well, I'll be damned  
Here comes your ghost again  
But that's not unusual  
It's just that the moon is full  
And you happened to call  
And here I sit  
Hand on the telephone  
Hearing a voice I'd known  
A couple of light years ago  
Heading straight for a fall_

  

Robert Plant
