## Hello

Hi Alex and Sophie,  
  
I have bad news. Grandma was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer and we are planning for the final phase. We flew out here to Vancouver on Monday 6/9 from Jersey and extended our stay until next Thursday the 19th. Chi-ah joined us a day later on Tuesday. In the last 4 days, her condition has not bettered at all and but she went through today's procedure with flying colors - slowing down the Jaundice stemming from bile flowing the wrong way by putting a stent(?) to direct the bile flow correctly and put the liver out of harms way.  
  
Anyway she walked out from the hospital room back home and had a full meal that she enjoyed - she was chewing up a chicken salad sandwich with her left hand while her right hand tended to her mouth with spoonfuls of Chinese clear both. Today was a very good day! with a strong finish!  
  
Last night, the doctor asked us to be ready to transition her under Hospice care in the next 1-3 weeks. Right now, she is under Canada's new _Home Care_ program that provides the same care you get at the hospital but at home. We will figure things out as we go - us returning, etc.  
  
Grandma let us know exactly how she wants things to play out going forward- no chemo, no radiation therapies, and no surgery. When the time comes, let comfort guide her there. She said she will be comfortable at the nearby hospice near VGH. - Ok that's it!  
  
more to come!  
  
Love you both,
