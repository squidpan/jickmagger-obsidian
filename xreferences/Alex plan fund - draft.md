## Hello

Hi Alex,

I regret we didn't get too far the last time we met so let's forget all that.

We will be happy to help fund the Radiology certificate program you expressed interest in enrolling at Bergen Community College (BCC) in Paramus NJ. We will fund you up to $10K spread over next 2 years.

We will make direct payments to the school. Please know that support will be made semester by semester and that continued support will be contingent upon satisfactory completion of the semester, which means that we would want to see your grades.

Given that your progress and success matter to us, we would like to create a system of accountability that will enable you to advance in your studies. First and foremost, we would like to see you be accepted into the program.

In addition, please send us the following information:

1.  Complete description of the program, school, and certificate you will obtain.

2. Academic program and calendar for the 2 years of study, including a list of courses you will take each semester.

3. Itemized list of costs (tuition, fee, etc.) and payment deadlines for the duration of program

Lastly, we hear about AI's *positive* impact in the medical fields leading to better *patient* care and potentially reduced costs, etc. Great! But how will it impact me and my profession?

It's probably too early to tell, but keeping an eye out for AI seems a good way to stay resilient in the face of AI driven changes.

OK now, let us know what you think!

We love you, Alex
					from all of us


*(I advise that you pay the school directly. I assume that youâ€™ll keep the money and make semester by semester disbursement? )*
