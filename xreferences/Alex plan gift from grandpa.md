## Hello

Hi Alex,  
  
This is Grandpa!  
  
I am back from the hospital recovering and I wanted you to know that I didn't forget about you. I brainstormed with the family for best ways to help you get on the training path you mentioned.  
  
We are all onboard, so, let's start over!  
  
I will be happy to help you pay for the Radiology certificate program you are interested in enrolling at Bergen Community College (BCC).  
  
I will be able to send a total of up to $10k spread over the next 2 years to support your studies. It will be a payment (a gift and not a loan) if you complete the program successfully; but if you drop out without finishing the program, then it reverts to a loan and you would need to pay back (no interest).  
  
We will make direct payments to the school. Please know that support will be made semester by semester and that continued support will be contingent upon satisfactory completion of the semester, which means that we would want to see your grades.  
  
Given that your progress and success matter to us, we would like to create a system of accountability that will enable you to advance in your studies. we would like you to be accepted into the program. Please send us the acceptance letter from the school.  
  
In the meantime, please send us the following information:  
  
1.Â  Complete description of the program, school, and certificate you will obtain.  
1. Academic program and calendar for the 2 years of study, including a list of courses you will take each semester.  
2. Itemized list of costs (tuition, fee, etc.) and payment deadlines for the duration of program  
  
Lastly, we hear about AI's positive impact in the medical fields leading to better patient care and potentially reduced costs, etc.  
  
All this to say, be *Resilient*! Stay informed about how AI impacts your field and be open to experimenting with new approaches so you can adapt.  
  
OK now, let us know what you think!  
  
I love you, Alex  
from all of us
