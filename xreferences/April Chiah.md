## Hello

tell

Hi Chi-ah,

We are already at the end of April straying into May. You doing OK? Here is the update on things:

Woojin's travel plan is all set - he is coming to NJ (airbnb near us) in a week on Wednesday 5/7 until Fri 5/16 when he flies out to Boston stay for a day or two before he flies back to Vancouver (from Boston). We are looking forward to it. If he can see Sophie that would be great but if not, I told him not to insist on it. Let's see, what else?
  
We got robbed like a month ago in the AM between 930-1140 while we were at Panera Bread next door. I forgot to lock the UPPER lock! what a Stupid ass I am. HE went straight to Jinie's room and grabbed the jewelry boxes that she so carefully arranged and stacked as if you are picking up a take out order neatly packaged. Many of them priceless. So she was very very upset. She dealt with the agony but now she says she is over it. 

GREAT news tho. Jinie passed the American naturalization citizenship interview and she is now an American! We received her passport.  That was UNBELIEVABLE - She put in a lot of effort into it. there were drama until the very end of the process but its over. This was very important for her and us.

We went to see Buckethead at Sony Hall theatre in the city (times square) and it was great. We bought the ticket before we got robbed!

I finally started on East of Eden. I am 1/4 along the way - soon that woman is going to hurt everyone around her. This is the 2nd book of John Steinbeck that I read following Of mice and men.

Talk to you soon.
Love, paul
