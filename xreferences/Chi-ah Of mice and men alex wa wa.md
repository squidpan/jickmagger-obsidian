Like the pine trees lining the winding road  
I've got a name, I've got a name  
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad  
I've got a name, I've got a name  
  
And I carry it with me like my daddy did  
But I'm livin' the dream  
That he kept hid  
  
Movin' me down the highway  
Rollin' me down the highway  
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by  
  
Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky  
I've got a song, I've got a song  
Like the whip-poor-will and the baby's cry  
I've got a song, I've got a song

And I carry it with me and I sing it loud  
If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud
  
Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway  
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by
And I'm gonna go there free 
  
Like the fool I am and I'll always be  
I've got a dream, I've got a dream
They can change their minds, but they can't change me  
I've got a dream, I've got a dream
  
Oh, I know I could share it if you want me to  
If you're goin' my way, I'll go with you
  
Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway  
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway  
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by
