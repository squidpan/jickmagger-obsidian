## 2025 02 04 Text from Chi-ah
Hi Paul, how is the conversation with Alex going? In case there is agreement to fund his studies, I I wouldn’t give him the while amount right away. First, ask him to get accepted into the program and show the tuition bill. I would support semester by semester and make continued support contingent upon satisfactory completion of the semester or year, if payment for full year is required. This is not being stingy, but creating a structure of accountability that helps him focus. It also shows that his progress and success matter, that you’re not just throwing money at him and leaving him deal with it (but secretly worry if he’ll follow through)You show care, that you are following and accompanying him. Now dad/ you want to give him pocket money, you are free to give it to them however way you want, but finds for degree should ne disbursed with structure and care.

Hi Chi-ah, thank you so much for this. 
	
	Chi-ah, chi-ah best sister in the world!

I was thinking along the same lines and you laid it out perfectly. I will do it like that once I decide to put things in motion.

In the past 2-3 weeks, things got complicated: Dad went to the hospital 2 days ago and is under observation. Mom was lucky to have asked this doctor in the building who called the ambulance because he was coughing up black stuff (internal bleeding?..). It is snowing over in Vancouver... 

As for me, things are getting a little rough - got hit with a huge tax bill, need to move (owner is selling) and my ex sued me again so I had to get a lawyer again.

So, Alex is gonna have to wait until I figure things out. 
I don't think I can effectively handle interacting with Dad, Alex, Ex, all unstable characters.
