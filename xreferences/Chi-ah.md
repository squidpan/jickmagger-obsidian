## Hello

Hello Chi-ah, today is Sophieâ€™s 25th birthday born in 1999. She is  amazing as a daughter. She has been thru a lot the past several years so I hope she will be able to forget all that today. 

My surgery last week went well and I am resting and taking it easy. Movies/TV shows are not fun anymore and I feel like I have seen them all. With a big part what I consumed as entertainment was no longer. It felt dumb and sad. During this time,

I started to follow NY sports teams and it's exciting. WFAN radio station is what I listen to for commentaries before and after the games. I sat though the highs and lows of what fans go through from the sidelines. Now I have become one.  

I also bought an eBook reader and I started to read books from the my public library in Edgewater. It's great! - eBooks, audio-books! I say better late than never! 

Right now, I am reading The Lost City of Z by David Grann. I read Killers of the Flower Moon by him before.

Jinie will be in Korea for about a month starting in late December - to take care of her parents, see LJ her son and take care of whatever needs to be taken care of.

Next year we should get together and hang out. 
miss you
