subject: Woojins visit to Edgewater
created: 2025-03-26

## Hello

I imagine that Woojin will have many things he wants to do here. Mom and Dad gladly will take care of the airfare and we will take care of the rest (food, lodging, entertainment, etc.) 

My work schedule wont be an issue AT ALL while he is here. :)
Has Sook is in Palisades Park is a spitting distance away (like 10 - 15mins) from Edgewater. If he wants to be alone, go dark, and fly under the radar, he can take public transportation to/from the city and Edgewater.

We (Jinie really) are also trying to set up meetings with eligible Korean women in the area but no guarantees! Again Jinie championed the idea - I am so grateful for her gesture.

I just want him to enjoy the trip - away from Vancouver. 
And who knows? This can be a turning point for him. If not, no big deal.
