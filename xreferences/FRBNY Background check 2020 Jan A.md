Hi Lindsey,

Here are some updates as of 2020 Jan 31. I made the following payments today as I agreed:

2. Time warner / (Enhance Recovery): I called 800-497-8127 and made payment out of my 7750 debit card for $1.09. They will send out a confirmation letter sometime next week. I will send it to you once I get it.
3. JPMC #3909: I called 866-252-5777 and paid $30 out of my checking account. They will send out a confirmation letter sometime next week. I will send it to you once I get it.
4. JPMC #1122: I called 866-252-5777 and paid $20 out of my checking account. They will send out a confirmation letter sometime next week. I will send it to you once I get it.

Hi Frankie,

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do.

Here is the status from today:

- Today, (1/22/2020), I made  additional  arrangements for the 2 new credit card accounts (items #5, #6) to make regular payments of $20/month starting on 1/31/2020 and 2/15/2020 for Chase cards ending in 1122 and 2592 respectively.
- Regarding the payment arrangements made yesterday (1/21/2020) for Chase cards ending in 3903 and 3712 (item #3, #4 below): _The Chase card representative I spoke to today, Greg (emp id V140675) informed me they_ can’t send of a payment arrangement agreement letters before I start paying. He informed me that the representative I worked with yesterday, Keith Roy, misinformed me about the fact that payment arrangement letters can be sent out prior_. They will send out a payment confirmation letter in the mail each time the payments processed_
- The monthly amounts and the pay dates are all entered into the system with voice recordings of my approvals of the plan but they are not allowed to send out such letters unless the monthly amounts are much higher and the pay back period much shorter. He said to start paying in what I can afford regularly and revisit the payment plan to enhance it.
- As of now I have committed to making regular monthly payments with 6 creditors (#1-#6) and exhausted my monthly budget I allocated to pay creditors.  So my plan is to execute on the payment plan I proposed for these 6 creditors and for the rest of the 3 creditors (#7-#9), I would like to reassess my financial situation in about 6 months and decide whether I can follow up on my initial conversation with them on 1/17/2020.
- I will make sure to report back on my payment promises with the receipt letters from each payment.

So here is the status:

1. Macy’s credit card (Credit Control):  AGREEMENT LETTER is on its way.

- I spoke to Jamilex Lugo@1-888-401-9026  Ext 69 on Friday 1/17/2020 and today again (1/21/2020) and signed up for automatic payments out of my account.
- I start payment ($50.48/mo) on 1/31/2020
- Ms. Lugo put in a request to send out the agreement letter both via email and regular mail. I expect to get the email by the end of this week and via regular mail sometime next week.

2. Time warner / (enhance recovery): AGREEMENT LETTER RECEIVED. See attached – Start payment 1/31/2020
