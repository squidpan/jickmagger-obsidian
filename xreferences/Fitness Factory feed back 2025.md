Please bring Ronda back to teach Thursday Yoga class!!!. I hope you do NOT brush off this feedback. I went to last Thursday's yoga class and we were all waiting for the new instructor, Angela? turns out she was training her private client right next door and didnt realize class start time had passed. When I went to get her she was unapologetic and kept saying √è was training her private client" there were 4total and two left in less than 5 mins. Please get Ronda back or someone who is professional! Very disappointed with the new Yoga teacher.
