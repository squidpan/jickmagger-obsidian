## Hello
Hi dad, I’m good! Sorry I’ve been so unresponsive I’ve been really bad at responding to things. How are you? It’s nice you’ve been reading still. I haven’t been keeping up with reading other than the new hunger games book, but have been running still. 

Also I switched jobs a little over a month ago! I had to buy a car which was a huge hassle but I got a good deal off Facebook for a used Honda Crv. 

And now I work with adults with serious mental illness out in the community (so I drive around a lottt) and so far I love it. The pay is obviously terrible but it’s not forever![😁](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f601/32.png) Anyway hows your health? And is uncle woojin there? I replied to him finally seeing if he’d want to hang out when he’s in boston
