## What is Mule Domain Project
A Mule Domain Project is used to configure shared resources that can be accessed from Mule applications. Shared resources can be used by all the Mule apps associated with the domain. Each Mule app can be associated with only one domain at a time. You can us Studio or by editing your project's pom.xml file directly.

### Shared Resources
Examples of shared resources include the following:
- HTTP ports. Exposes multiple mule applications/APIs over the same HPPTS/TLS port
- TLS configuration for Mule server certificates and client certificates; keystores and truststores
- Ensure consistency between applications upon any changes
