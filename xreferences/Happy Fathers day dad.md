## Hello

Happy Father's day, Dad!

I am so happy and relieved that we are all here and be with you on Father's day. Who knew?

Who knew that today is the only day that is sunny all around with no clouds no rain. that celebrated Vancouver June!

Who knew that we had that amazing chinese food not once but twice and  lots of left over.
