## Hello

Hi Sophie,
Happy 25th birthday! Wow, a quarter century has past since you came to us at Melrose-Wakefield hospital! - Rosy cheeks, STRONG grip with a ROARING voice, everyone in the hospital knew you arrived!.  I hope you will be around with loving friends today.

I had a little outpatient procedure to take care of my arrhythmia. Everything went well and I am resting and recovering!! Will I be able to see you sometime during this holiday season? Will you be coming to NJ? Maybe I can come see you sometime once I am back on my feet and am able to drive.

I am reading The Lost city of Z by David Grann. I love it.
Love and miss you.
dad
