## Hi Kids

Grandpa is recovering from the hospital where he was ambulanced in when Grandma saw him caughing up black matter - fortunately, grandma asked a doctor in the building about the black stuff and he immediately shipped him to the hospital. He has been there since the weekend and will soon be released (today, tomorrow?). So far so good.


It has been snowing there (rarity) and for the next several days. When you get a chance please drop him a get well note. Grandma and grandma will be happy to hear from you guys.
