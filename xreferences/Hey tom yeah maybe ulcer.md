## Hello

Hey Tom, maybe. Thatâ€™s what they suspect caused the bleeding but they do t know and want me to get checked out by a Gastroenterologist. I never had ulcer, I don't think. None of my docs ever told me.

  

Hyponatremia, low sodium level, is what they are really concerned about and want me to go see a Nephrologist, a Kidney guy, asap. They said I'm gonna fucking die if I don't. so that's what im gonna do.
