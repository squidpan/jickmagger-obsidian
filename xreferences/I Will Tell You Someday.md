## LYRICS

"I'll Tell You Someday" is the lead track from Plini's second full-length album, "Impulse Voices," which was released on November 27, 2020. The album features contributions from various musicians, including Chris Allison on drums, Simon Grove on bass, Dave Mackay on piano and synthesizer, John Waugh on saxophone, and Amy Turk on electro-acoustic harp. Plini described the song as a "big, warm, instrumental hug" intended to provide a friendly first impression of the album's sound and energy, although he noted that the rest of the album ventures into stranger territory.54

The song was first streamed on October 8, 2020, and later released on Bandcamp as part of the album.34 It received mixed reviews, with some praising its melodic and technical aspects, while others felt it was less impactful than previous works.
