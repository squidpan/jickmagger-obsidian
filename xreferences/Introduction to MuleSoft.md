## What is MuleSoft
a toolset which enables orgamizations to create, integrate, model, and deploy services, APIs, and Mule applications.

### About Anypoint Platform
A set of tools and fameworks that enable you to design, deploy, and manage a network of applications, data, and services based on API-led connectivity. Anypoint Platform also provides the runtime environement where you deploy integration applications and expose APIs

### The Application Network

Problems to solve:
- The application landscape of a modern IT infrastructure is a collection of disparate applications and data sources.
- An organizational infrastructure may include multiple combinations of SaaS applications, databases, CRM systems, and legacy systems.
- Designing an application that can connect to these disparate systems requires you to work with a variety of protocols, credentials, data formats, etc.
- This often results in applications and data that are segregated and difficult to integrate. 
- Code written to perform one integration task may not be reusable in another. 
- Addtionally, when one component becomes unavailable, this can cause performance bottlenecks and disruptions.

To solve these integration problems, Anypoint Platform enables you to develop an application network that seamlessly connects applications, data, and devices through a common set of protocols. It also greatly simplifies the way applications and devices can interact with each other and how they share data. An application network provides a seamless network of applications, datam and devices, that can run in the cloud or in your own IT infrastructure.

### API-Driven Development
The API is one of the core elements of the application network. APIs define the contract that enables different components of your IT infrastructure to communicate and share data. To promote integration and connectivity between the components within the application network, Anypoint Platform supports and promotes an API-Driven development model. Anypoint Platform provides tools that enable you to design and simulate the behavior of an API. It also promotes iterative development process tha enables you to gain feedback about your API.

To define an API, Anypoint Platform uses the REWSTful API Modeling Language (RAML). RANK is based in YAML and is both human- and machine-readable. This enables you to define an API more generally, without having to write connectivity code in a specific programming language.

### Primary Platform Components

- Mule Runtimes: Serves as an API Gateway to expose proxy APIs that call backend services.
- Ã€nypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (PCE): _Management Plane_ that allows uses to publish/rvise/delete APIs and manage policies on those APIs. The PCE is architected in a Hot (CC3) to Cold (CC1) configuraition
- Anypoint Studio: Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
