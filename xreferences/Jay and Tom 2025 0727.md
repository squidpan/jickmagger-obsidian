## Hello

Hello guys,

Mom was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer as we flew out to Vancouver during the first week of June following my brother's visit. We ended up staying until near the end of June. Claire, my sister, came out as well so it was the 2nd reunion all together as a family - a blessing and a rare occurrence in my family.

We got a team of care givers around Mom and Dad ( ~= 24x7), worked with them for several days, somehow try to get a handle on *things* and plan daily routines for what's to come.

My dad, three days later, had a stroke and got shipped to Vancouver General Hospital(VGH). He was discharged 3 days ago and is back at home. BTW, they live near Univ. of British Columbia (UBC). Its a nice area close to downtown. Many many Chinese people in Vancouver so good Chinese food! City is full of glass towers like in Hong Kong back in the 80's reflecting grey, gloomy sky and rain drops most of the year.

~~Things are stacked up against Jinie's Mom (& dad) too - she had to fly out in a hurry to take care of the situation. ~~

~~By the way she was and continues to be instrumental in guiding and helping us (such a fucking clueless bunch and that's me, my sister and my brother) thru. the process while she does the same for hers. ~~

~~With the experience of being around many elder folks from a big family and all its saga, she held all of our hands (us kids, mom, dad) through the days and it was *next level* ~~

At times, I am so overwhelmed. So much is going on at an unpredictable pace and in their own sequences ~~and now I also realize that they are ALL linked and related!!~~

OK, That's all for now.

more to come.

Hello guys,  
  
Mom was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer as we flew out to Vancouver during the first week of June following my brother's visit. We ended up staying until near the end of June. Claire, my sister, also came out so it was the 2nd reunion all together as a family - a blessing and a rare occurrence in my family.  
  
We started to get a team of caregivers around both parents ( ~= 24x7), worked with them for several days, somehow to try to get a handle on the whole operation and plan daily routines for what's to come. like food, cleaning, etc.  
  
My dad, three days later, had a stroke and went to the Hospital(VGH). He got back a week ago after being in the hospital for 33 days.

  

So much has been going on at an unpredictable pace and in their own sequences.

  

OK, That's all for now.
