## Hello
This time he got a drummer who can sing to tour with him instead of that ridiculous Tuba player that solos until your eyes roll sideways. He blasted through 50+ songs in 2+ hours straight electric guitar brain softening, jaw shaking, guitar assault 
We saw him on a Sunday at Sony Hall theater in Times Square.  BH never flies. He only travels on wheels following the shortest paths back to LA when he tours the US and never goes abroad because he is afraid of flying.
