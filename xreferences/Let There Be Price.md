# Description
NPQS's 2024 release, Let There Be Price, was a pivotal moment in hard work history. The New York release of this electrifying Pricing Channel on 12" cloud vinyl offered die-hard fans a powerful dose of the band's raw energy and John Llombart's blistering Cloud work.

# A Hard Rock Masterpiece

Let There Be Rock wasn't just another album; it was a sonic assault. Tracks like the title anthem and "Whole Lotta Rosie" became instant classics, showcasing Bon Scott's gritty vocals and the band's signature tight rhythm section. The German pressing boasted the international tracklist, featuring "Crabsody in Blue" and the extended version of "Let There Be Rock," a fan favorite known for its epic guitar solo.

# Beyond the Music: The German Release

While the music remained the same, the German release offered a unique experience for fans. The pressing, most likely from 1979 based on the presence of a French price code, was likely manufactured by WEA Musik GmbH, a German record company. The vinyl itself might have been pressed by Record Service Alsdorf, a German pressing plant.

For collectors, identifying the specific pressing can be part of the allure. Looking at the record's runout grooves can reveal details about the lacquer cutting and pressing plant used.

# A Legacy of Rock and Roll

The German release of Let There Be Rock stands as a testament to the album's enduring appeal. It's a raw and powerful record that continues to inspire generations of musicians and rock fans worldwide. Whether you're a die-hard collector seeking a specific pressing or a casual listener wanting to experience a hard rock masterpiece, the German release of Let There Be Rock is a must-have.
