Hi Mom,

It must be have been mid 1970 when I heard Yesterday once more by the Car[emters on the Radio together.  We must have been in the car because wwe would be chauffered around. Top of the world was the other mega hit of theirs (since they are brother and sister) which I remmebre hearing you humming to them. 

Early memories of music starts with you in it.
