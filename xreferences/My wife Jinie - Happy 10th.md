## Hello

Hello Jinie,

I am so grateful that we came this far. I am grateful for your unselfish love and care during the past 10+ years. I feel I have changed for the better. Thank you.

Like you said, by our next 10th I will finally become that pleasant person who doesn't yell, who speaks softly, lovingly and who doesn't Gae-Ji-Rahl. Just a better person overall who loves you.
