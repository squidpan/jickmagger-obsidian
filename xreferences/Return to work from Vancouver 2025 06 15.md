## Hello

Hey Guys,

Mom was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer and we have been out here a full week since last Monday. Right now, I extended my stay in Vancouver and plan to return by Wed. 6/25, a week and a half out from tomorrow.

I need additional time to get a team of care givers around Mom and Dad, work with them for several more days and plan for the final phase.

I will be able to jump right back into the mulesoft basic npqs training stuff with a few days work and begin to work with Bin, the first designated npqs mulesoft guinea pig to test out the material and build on it - once I get back.

paul
