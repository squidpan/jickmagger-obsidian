## Hello
Hi Sophie,
 
 First of all, I miss you very much so can you please send me some photographs of you, you and your friends etc. BTW is Luc and Nichole there again still? :)  
 
It's already been a year since we all got together with the Grandma/pa and Chi-Ah gomo. Everyone but Woojin.

Well, he is coming to visit us in the States from 5/6/Tues - 5/18/Sun and hike up to Boston for a visit to his old school neighborhood and to see you, his favorite niece. Could be 5/17/Sat but nothing is decided. Will you be around? Please let us know.

How are you doing? Are you sleeping and eating OK - healthy? Still running? And are people around you treating you nicely? I hope they do because you are a great person! If not call me. I will see what I can do!

Sophie, you were telling me last year that you were considering a career in social service. Are you in the process of changing jobs? How is that going?

BTW, please use the FSA card (and Health Equity website submit receipts) to get the service you need like Glasses, Contact lenses, Dental cleaning, whatever you can get done! etc. Let me know if you need anything and the card info again.

My reading adventure continues. I am such a slow reader that I am not able to finish a book within the loan period of 2 weeks. If I am able to renew the loan and if no one else is waiting on it, then I get another go at it. I couldn't finish both of Donna Tartt's books, The Goldfinch and The Secret History - too long 

I finished To Kill a Mockingbird and that was a great read. I seem to like old backdrops of story in classics then modern settings.

More to come. 
I love you,
Dad
