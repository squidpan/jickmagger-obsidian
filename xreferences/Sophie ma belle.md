## Hello

Sophie Ma Belle,
Let me know when I can pick you up tomorrow for lunch - 11:30, 12? I am flexible so it can be whenever. I just want to make sure that you allow enough time. 
This time it will have to be without Alex. Alex and I are not on the same page which will require a different track of conversation to be had on a different day, not tomorrow.

love you, see you tomorrow.
