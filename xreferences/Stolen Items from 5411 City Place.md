## What happened?

- 2025-03-19, Our apartment at City Place was broken into and approximately $300k worth of valuables from my wife's bedroom. These are priceless possessions she accumulated over decades from her mother and family. Roughly, here is the breakdown of what was stolen
- My wife and I were at Panera Bread from 9:20 AM - 11:30 AM
- 20 pairs of ear-rings, 30 rings (approximately $5000/ring), 3 necklaces, etc. ) and an expensive women's hand bag valued at $60k. (Hermes, Gray & white color)
- Jinie initially told the police incorrectly that about $30k was missing but it was more like $300k - She got confused converting Korean Won to Dollars
- We dont have any pictures, serial numbers and or receipts of the stolen items other than the two attached pictures

Can you forward us the policy report?

Thank you.

paul & Jinie
