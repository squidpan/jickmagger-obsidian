## Hello

Superman, I really appreciate it! 

Ulcer? Maybe. That’s what they suspect caused the bleeding in the abdomen but they don't know and want me to get checked out by a Gastroenterologist. I never had ulcer, I don't think. None of my docs ever told me.

Hyponatremia, low sodium level, is what they are really concerned about and want me to go see a Nephrologist, a Kidney guy, asap. They said I'm gonna fucking die if I don't. so that's what im gonna do.

My own worst enemy came to town, grabbed me good and this time took care of business - not supposed to happen 'to me cause it’s only a fucking song. 

_Your world keeps turning round & round But everything is upside down_

My mind going full blast at all times failed what’s holding it.

I am doing much better - thank god.
dude, thanks again.
