## Hello

Hi Woojin,

~~Remind me. Is Hiroshi away in Japan now and will not be returning to Vancouver until next March or May? Are you sleeping there or upstaires these days?~~


Hello Woojin,
I agree that you should offer to do only what you can afford. Which is... 1) you sleep overnight at his apt, (no signing of any contracts) and 2) you keep an eye on his place and you pay him $500/mo, CASH? If so, that's what you will tell him. If he can't agree, then you have to move on.

Now, focus on how you are going to, if you had your own place, how you would commute to/fro Hampton place for things JLF just can't do.  **Isn't this what you want?** If that sounds like the end game you want then consider starting earlier.  
  
I heard from dad that he owns a property or two when I was there. At that time, I told him that he should use them towards financing the care cost and start talking to the banks.  
  
If you have a place with your name on it, I would seriously consider it and try to make it work. Sometimes you have to just have to go for it and that may set the stage for something else, leading to something good.

~~Look at it this way. Mom and Dad fed you, put a roof over your head and continues to support you financially and it certainly wasn't their choice for you to live with them all this time. You have visibility into the family's finances and you know what you want and need (separate place...). ~~

Hi Hyong,

With dad at home now, it's even harder.  I don't think I can maintain mental sanity and my OWN life any more.  Forget about looking for a new job, I don't sleep more than 4 hours due to stress.
I know you told me this before.
I need to move out.  But again, I can't afford much.
So I think negotiating w/ Hiroshi and at least sleeping there, will help me be away physically at night/morning.
I will have to offer Only what I can afford and he plans to come live here for few months from March or May after retiring from his job.
You might say, Why not move away out of building?  Well money is issue.
Also there is some advantage of me being in same building since I can use the car for my own Dr. visits since bus wastes a lot of time.
BUT, I know mom and dad will STILL call me whenever the heck they want me.
And I have to dodge bullets to avoid being distracted still.
How am I going to just eat my dinner and get the heck out though?
I have to go into parent's unit at least 1-2 times/day but still maintain my autonomy.
Right now, I'm like a dog on a leash, I get pulled this way, that way...never ends.

Dad has few blood test per week coming up.
Next week it's once/week.
If mom decides to do Radio therapy...more.

So yes, I need advice on how I can manage my independence from them, while living on 5th floor but eating on 11th floor (dinner).

I will still have same amount of chores to do for parents, yes.
