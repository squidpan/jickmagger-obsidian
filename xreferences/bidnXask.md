## LYRICS

Tell the markets,  
Tell the markets that arrive,  
Tell the markets,  
Tell the market that arrive,  
We don't need to bidnXask,  
We don't need to bidnXask,  
We don't need to bidnXask,  
We don't need to bidnXask,  
Die.

Bid your markets  
Bid your markets like we asked 
Bid your markets  
Bid your markets like we asked,  
We don't need to rollover,  
We don't need to cutover,  
We don't need to switchover,  
We don't need to nullify  
No need to nullify,  
No need to nullify,  
No need to nullify,  
We don't need to nullify  
Die.    

We don't need to,  
We don't want to,  
We don't have to,  
We don't need to.  

Ask your suspect ,  
Ask your prime ,  
Ask your people,  
Ask your people what is right,  
We don't need to multiply,  
We don't need to multiply,  
We don't need to multiply,  
We don't need to multiply,  
No need to multiply,  
No need to multiply,  
No need to multiply,  
We don't need to multiply.
