## Hello


*Hello YellowToe, for your eyes only - text to mom a minute ago - I had texted her a few times in the past 2 months asking her about Alex’s application status but no update ever came.* 

  
Margaret, here is an update: 

Grandpa had to return back to ER last Sunday and got transferred to regular room just yesterday. This was only after he returned home from being away in the hospital for 36 straight days, 3 weeks ago. 

Grandma continues to be under 24x7 home care stage 1B pancreatic cancer. She is surprisingly holding up well and we are trying to plan accordingly. 

  

As soon as he woke up today, Grandpa called me from the hospital (VGH) and wanted to let me know that he is running into severe financial distress due to the continuing high care cost and that he wanted Alex to know that, at this point regrettably, he will not be able to help fund his certificate.


He continues to be under observation as his hemoglobin level is unstable and not give up hope.

Grandpa wishes Alex the best of luck and wants him not to give up and keep trying like grandpa will and he wants him to know that he loves Alex very much.
